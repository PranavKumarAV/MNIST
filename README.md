# MNIST
CNN algorithm is applied to the MNIST dataset. Initially without Data Augumentation the dataset is used and later Data Augumentation is done and the dataset is used to train the algorithm and it's minimum point is obtained.

This MNIST code was the First task for my Summer Intern in 2021.

Details of Training:

Batch Size    : 240.

No. of epochs : 25.

Accuracy and Losses without Data Augumentation:

Training accuracy   : 99.94%.

Training losses     : 0.2%.

Validation accuracy : 99.23%.

Validation losses   : 3.48%.
